# MVP Development Checklist for Data Processing and Analytics Platform

## 1. Identify the Core Problem
- [ ] Clearly define the specific problem your product will solve.
- [ ] Ensure that the MVP focuses solely on addressing this core issue.

## 2. Determine Your Target Audience
- [ ] Identify the primary users who will benefit from your product.
- [ ] Ensure that the MVP caters to their specific needs and use cases.

## 3. List the Core Features
- [ ] Include only the essential features necessary to solve the core problem:
  - [ ] Data ingestion (allow data uploads, e.g., CSV files).
  - [ ] Basic data processing (e.g., cleaning, normalizing data).
  - [ ] Simple analytics (e.g., trend analysis, anomaly detection).
  - [ ] Context enrichment (e.g., time stamps, geographic data).
  - [ ] Basic dashboard (e.g., visualizations like bar or line charts).

## 4. Create Simple User Flows
- [ ] Map out the main user interactions with the product:
  - [ ] Ingest flow: user uploads data.
  - [ ] Processing flow: system cleans and transforms data.
  - [ ] Analytics flow: simple analysis algorithms run.
  - [ ] Context enrichment flow: results are enhanced with metadata.
  - [ ] Presentation flow: user views results in a dashboard.

## 5. Build Prototypes or Mockups
- [ ] Create a basic prototype or wireframe to visualize user interaction.
- [ ] Ensure the prototype allows testing of core features (data upload, analytics, dashboard).

## 6. Define Success Criteria
- [ ] Establish metrics to measure MVP success:
  - [ ] Data is processed, and insights are delivered within 24 hours.
  - [ ] User feedback indicates that the insights are valuable.
  - [ ] Dashboard is intuitive and easy to use.
  - [ ] Set a target for early user adoption (e.g., at least 10 businesses).

## 7. Launch MVP and Gather Feedback
- [ ] Release the MVP to a select group of early adopters.
- [ ] Collect detailed feedback on:
  - [ ] Ease of data upload.
  - [ ] Relevance of analytics results.
  - [ ] Usability of the dashboard.
- [ ] Document requests for additional features or improvements.

## 8. Iterate Based on Feedback
- [ ] Use the collected feedback to prioritize improvements and new features.
- [ ] Refine the product, adding more advanced features like:
  - [ ] Additional analytics algorithms.
  - [ ] Customization options for the dashboard.
  - [ ] Enhanced context enrichment with external datasets.
